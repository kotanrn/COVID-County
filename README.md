# COVID-County


# DO NOT SAVE / RUN THIS ON YOUR DESKTOP! IT WILL FILL UP YOUR SCREEN WITH A LOT OF DATA FILES!
Instead, put the script in it's own folder such as COVID or County. and run it there.

Written in Python 2.7, this project uses John's Hopkins data to identify recent trends of infection in a user selected county.

Requirements:

-- python version 2.7
  
  Windows: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.17/python-2.7.17.amd64.msi
  
  Mac: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.17/python-2.7.17-macosx10.9.pkg

-- Dependencies

  pip install pprint matplotlib scipy pandas numpy
  
  
  

Soon, it will use matplotlib to display those trends.

Later, it will calculate Rt values to predict if that selected county is "winning the fight" against COVID-19 (SAR-CoV-2).
