# COVID-County

Written in Python 2.7, this project uses John's Hopkins data to identify recent trends of infection in a user selected county.

Soon, it will use matplotlib to display those trends.

Later, it will calculate Rt values to predict if that selected county is "winning the fight" against COVID-19 (SAR-CoV-2).
