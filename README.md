# COVID visualization

Written in Python 2.7, this project uses John's Hopkins data to visualize COVID infection data for a user selected county.

#### County.py:
Shows a graph of active infections of a user-selected country, state/province, or county.

#### States.py:
Displays all active infections of all US states on the most current data only.

## Requirements:
### python version 2.7
#### Windows:
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.17/python-2.7.17.amd64.msi
#### Mac:
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.17/python-2.7.17-macosx10.9.pkg

## Dependencies:
  pip install pprint matplotlib


## Common combined keys:
--- Bell, Texas, US

--- Coryell, Texas, US

--- Lampasas, Texas, US



### To do:
--- Calculate Rt values to predict if that selected county is "winning the fight" against COVID-19 (SAR-CoV-2).



# DO NOT SAVE / RUN THIS ON YOUR DESKTOP! IT WILL FILL UP YOUR SCREEN WITH A LOT OF DATA FILES!
## Instead, put the script in it's own folder such as COVID or County. and run it there.
